The story of the scene depicts a crook (the grey capsule) juggling a golden artifact that it stole.
Unaware that a cop (the cube with a gun) walks up, and demands the crook to surrender.
The crook realizing this, has no choice and gives the artifact to the cop, looking down in shame.

This animation attempts to convey the following emotions:
-happiness with the crook juggling the artifact
-frightened when the crook realizes the cop is there
-saddness upon surrendering the artifact
-anger with the cop nodding in dissapointment for what the crook has done

The following principles are used
-squash and stretch (artifact bouncing in the air)
-follow through and overlapping actio (the cop entering the scene)
-slow in and slow out (cop moving into scene)
-secondary action (crook looking up in the air as it juggles the artifact)
